# autinst

Automate your software installs.

A script with wich you can automate your software install on a freshly installed linux distro.

You don't need to install git to get this process, just do this (tested on Linux Mint LMDE 5):

-Create a new text file wich ends with .py ( test.py ).

-Copy your version of the script into this text file and save it.

-Open the terminal and "cd" to the directory in wich your file is (if it is on the desktop then type "cd Desktop").

-Open your python executable (like this for example: "python3 test.py" ).

-Click "Y" to everything and enjoy the comfort of not having to write every command for your software install every second week.
